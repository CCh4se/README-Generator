# ReadMe.md Generator

## Description 
We were tasked with creating a generator via javascript/nodejs. We needed to make sure that it allowed the user to enter information into the fields within the Integrated Terminal and see results via a README.md file. The user was asked a variety of questions; ranging from the title, the license, usage, and many more. Whenever the user would attempt to skip a question, they would receive a notification via the console they cannot skip. Overall, this will help us as a class utilize our time more and become efficient not having to worry about creating README.md's every time we have an assignment or project.
